/* Formatted assert.
 *
 * Asserts are a way to catch programmer errors at run-time. They should
 * be used when both of the following are true:
 * 1. It's impossible to catch the error at compile-time.
 * 2. The error is caused only by the programmer.
 * For example:
 * - removeobject for a local ID that isn't in the object event
 *   templates is a programmer error because the object could never be
 *   spawned.
 * - removeobject for a local ID that isn't spawned is not (necessarily)
 *   a programmer error because the object could have been despawned by
 *   the player.
 * - Trying to choose a move from the Fight menu when it's disabled is
 *   not a programmer error because the player is able to try to choose
 *   the move.
 * - The battle engine receiving a disabled move as the chosen move is
 *   a programmer error because it should have been rejected by the UI.
 *
 * When possible, prefer to catch errors at compile-time with things
 * like STATIC_ASSERT rather than at run-time with assertf.
 *
 * assertf(cond);
 * assertf(cond) { recovery... }
 * assertf(cond, fmt, ...);
 * assertf(cond, fmt, ...) { recovery... }
 *
 * If cond is FALSE:
 * - In a release build: executes the recovery code (if any).
 * - In a debug build: shows a resumable crash screen and executes the
 *   recovery code (if any).
 * - In a test build: causes the test to be INVALID.
 *
 * Usually the recovery code makes the function do nothing, for example:
 * - warp to a map that doesn't exist shouldn't warp anywhere.
 * - addobject of a local ID that doesn't exist shouldn't add anything.
 *
 * But sometimes the function has to return something, in which case the
 * recovery code does something that seems "reasonable", for example:
 * - CreateMonWithGenderNatureLetter should ignore an illegal gender or
 *   letter. */
